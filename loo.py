# Jordan Ellis solution below
# names = 0
# while names < 5:
    # name = input("Please enter a name: ")
    # print(name + " Is awesome!")
    # names = names + 1


# Palindrome attempt
# name = input("Input a word to reverse: ")
# for char in range(len(name) - 1, -1, -1):
#   print(name[char], end="")
#   print("\n")

# Leon's palindrome solution code below

# palinVar = input('TYPE IN: ')
# numChars = len(palinVar) - 1
# raVnilap = ''
# while numChars >= 0:
#     raVnilap = raVnilap  + palinVar[numChars]
#     numChars = numChars - 1
# if raVnilap == palinVar:
#     print('PALINDROME')
# else:
#     print('no')

#qa community exercise below
# for i in range(10, 21, 2): # prints numbers between 10 and 21 in mutiples of 2 (last number printed: 20)
#     print(i)
